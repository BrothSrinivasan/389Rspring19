## Assignment Writeup

### Part 1 (40 pts)

The flag I got from the command injection was CMSC389R-{d1gging_f0r_flag5_thr0ugh_1njec7ion}. And the command I used to get the flag was "; cd home; cat flags.txt;". My thought process during this project comes what I learned in 330. So, what I thought was that sometimes when programmer asks a user for a input, the programmer will trust what the user will give as an input. However, this is something a programmer should never do because someone, for example a hacker, can take advantage of this. This is especially true if the user is somewhat connected to the programmer's server when the input is asked for. This is because then the programmer is giving access of his/her server to the potentially hacker. So, using what I learned from that class, I wondered if the programmer prevented a user from writing more than he/she is allowed. I tested it by seeing what would happen if I gave it more instructions then it was expecting. So, I entered the ;, something I had learned from 216 and 330, and the rest of the commands as if I had access to the terminal to see if I could access the flags.txt. I first tried a simple command like "ls -la" to see if I could do something; it worked which worked because it listed all the folders in Moffet's root directory. So, then I used the command above to see if I could get the flag and that also worked. So, one way that Moffet can prevent this kind of attack is by checking for things like the length of the input given. This way an attacker can't just write a long script to access sensitive information. Also, Moffet needs to escape special characters and commands, in order to prevent such attacks in the future. Also, she can check if the the input is really a domain name or IP addressing by parsing the input to make sure she is getting input other than an domain name or IP address. Also, after implementing the shell, I was able to snoop around much more and found her .dig.sh folder in hre opt directory and it seems I was right to think Moffet just ran the input without any kind of validating the input. 

### Part 2 (60 pts)

In essence, the point of this interactive shell is provide an easy tool to access into Moffet's server without having to manually netcat into the terminal, only to be allowed to type one line of command which, everytime, ends up returning both the junk information and the information that you need. Moreover, that one line of input will end up being a really long line of input since at the end of the input the DiG will close itself. As it is very obvious, this manual version of extracting information can become very tiresome and can result in having to repeat a lot of the things you have done before since you can neither build of your previous work nor can you save your previous work. However, as a hacker, we want to be able to do things with ease. So, by creating an interactive shell that can connect to Moffet's terminal and save/output previous work, we can snoop through the terminal much faster and much more efficiently. For example, I was only able to find her .dig.sh file only after implementing the shell because everything became clean and readable. Also, by implementing an pull command, we can also save contents of Moffet's files without direct access to her terminal. This is very useful because it means I can steal her files and store it in my file without her noticing.
