## Assignment Writeup

### Part 1 (40 pts)

The flag I got from the command injection was CMSC389R-{d1gging_f0r_flag5_thr0ugh_1njec7ion}. And the command I used to get the flag was "; cd home; cat flags.txt;". My thought process during this project comes what I learned in 330. So, what I thought was that sometimes when programmer asks a user for a input, the programmer will trust what the user will give as an input. However, this is something a programmer should never do because someone, for example a hacker, can take advantage of this. This is especially true if the user is somewhat connected to the programmer's server when the input is asked for. This is because then the programmer is giving access of his/her server to the potentially hacker. So, using what I learned from that class, I wondered if the programmer prevented a user from writing more than he/she is allowed. I tested it by seeing what would happen if I gave it more instructions then it was expecting. So, I entered the ; and the rest of the commands as if I had access to the terminal to see if I could access the flags.txt. I first tried a simple command like "ls -la" to see if I could do something;it worked which worked. So, then I used the command above to see if I could get the flag and that also worked. So, one way that Moffet can prevent this kind of attack is by checking for things like the length of the input given. This way an attacker can't just write a long script to access sensitive information. Also, Moffet needs to escape special characters and commands, in order to prevent such attacks in the future. Also, she can check if the the input is really a domain name or IP addressing by parsing the input to make sure she is getting input other than an domain name or IP address.
