I would first out of respect, go to my boss to see what his response would be about this incident. Hopefully, I can convince him that we need to delay the release of the current version of the ECU firmware. I would try the moral route of pointing out all the potential deaths that we would cause. If that didn't work, then I would use finacial route to point out all the potential lawsuits we would potential face if this firmware when public. Unfortunately, some people are more fearful about losing money than about the hurting humanity. If neither worked, then I would try to release the infomation to the public/a consumer watchdog. Regardless of the potential consequence I could face, I would still release such infomation because sometimess it is necessary to scarifice everything for the greater good. However, I understand that it just wouldn't affect me. I could potentially tank the stock of my company and result in numerous workers being laid off. However, in my view I would feel more guilty being the cause of numerous death, something which one can never recover from, than being the cause of laying of people from their jobs, which is something one can recover from. Yet, one might argue against me that what is the point of living is to be free and independent, not dependent on others for services like foodstamps or shelter. While I acknowledge their point, the hard truth is that I am th one who is going have to live with the decision. While, obviously, neither of the choices are optimal, the choice where I prevent scenarios of parents not returning from their car rides or college students saying their last good-byes, allows me to sleep better at night than saving the jobsof the people living at the company, which is something people can try to get an another of.
