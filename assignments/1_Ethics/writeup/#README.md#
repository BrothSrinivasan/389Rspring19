I would first out of respect, go to my boss to see what his response would be to this incident. Hopefully, I can convince him that we need to delay the release of the current version of the ECU firmware. I would try the moral route of pointing out all the potential deaths that we would cause. If that didn't work, then I would use finacial route to point out all the potential lawsuits we would potential face if this firmware when public. If neither worked, then I would try to release the infomation to the public. Regardless of the potential consequence I could face. This is because sometimes the greater good is more important that the good of an individual. I understand that it just wouldn't affect me, and could potentially tank the stock of my company and result in the laying of the numerous workers. However, in my view I would feel more guilty being the cause of numerous death, something which one can never recover from, than being the cause of laying of people from their jobs, which is something people can recover from. Obviously, neither of the choice is optimal, but if it means saving lots of people then it is something I am going to have to life with.
